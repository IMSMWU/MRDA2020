# Preliminaries

Before we will start to analyze data in R, it is useful to recap some basics that you may remember from previous courses in marketing analytics. This chapter will serve as a foundation of the methods that we will learn and apply later, so make sure you are familiar with the concepts discussed here before proceeding. In particular, in this chapter you will learn:

* Why marketing research is important
* What type of research design is appropriate in which situation
* The difference between causality and correlation
* Which scales of measurement to use for different purposes
* The difference between validity and reliability

## Marketing research design

This chapter provides an overview over the parameters you need to consider when planning a marketing research study. It is very important to carefully consider these parameters when designing a study because empirical studies can be quite costly and you need to make sure that you will be able to interpret the results from your study in the desired way. For example, in many cases marketing research is about measuring the effectiveness of a firm's marketing instruments. As the nineteenth century Philadelphia retailer John Wanamaker supposedly said 

> "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted;  
> the trouble is I don't know which half."
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- John Wanamaker')`

As a marketing manager you may want to know the return on your marketing expenditures in order to allocate your marketing budget effectively. Measuring these causal effects is not trivial and requires careful planning as we will see later in this chapter.     

### Marketing foundations (recap)

You will surely have come across various definitions of the term *Marketing* during your studies. For example, the popular textbook by Kotler & Armstrong (2009) defines *Marketing* as: 

> "The process by which companies create value for customers and build strong 
> customer relationships in order to capture value from customers in return."
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Kotler & Armstrong (2009)')`

The corresponding process is depicted by Kotler & Armstrong (2009) as follows: 

<br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '90%',fig.align='center', fig.cap = "The marketing process Kotler & Armstrong (2009)"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/mr_process.JPG")
```

As the figure above shows, the goal of marketing is to capture value from customers to create profits and customer equity. However, in order to achieve this goal, a company needs to first build profitable relationships by creating customer value through an integrated marketing program. As you will also recall, the set of controllable tactical marketing tools can be described in terms of the `four Ps' taxonomy, which is also referred to as the **Marketing Mix**, consisting of:

* **Product** (design, quality, branding, technology, services, etc.)
* **Price** (list price, discounts, payment period, payment methods, etc.)
* **Place** (trade channels, locations, logistics, e-commerce, etc.)
* **Promotion** (advertising, sales promotion, public relations, etc.)

The firm blends these marketing tools to produce the desired response in the target market. As can be seen from the marketing process, the first step towards capturing customer value is to understand the marketplace and customer needs. Gaining a better understanding of the target customers through marketing research enables firms to design their marketing mix in accordance with the consumers needs and wants, which will then lead to positive outcomes on the customer side (e.g., trust, loyalty, satisfaction, engagement) and on the firm side (e.g., revenue, sales, profit, stock prices). Ultimately, this will lead to  

### The research process

--> Foundations

--> motivating example: behavioral targeting

Initial observation
Something that needs explaining (e.g. differences in sales between products)
Collect data and look for initial evidence 
Theory
A hypothesized general principle or set of principles that explains known findings about a topic and from which new hypotheses can be generated
Hypothesis
A prediction from a theory
E.g., personalized advertising is more effective than non-personalized advertising


<br><br><br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '50%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "The research process (Field et al. 2012)"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/research_process.JPG")
```

<br><br><br>

Collect data to test your theory

Example: 
Personalized advertising leads to higher sales

DV:
The proposed effect (an outcome variable)
Measured, not manipulated (in experiments)
E.g., sales in the above example

IDV:
The proposed cause (a predictor variable)
A manipulated variable (in experiments)
E.g., type of advertising in the above example



```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '90%',fig.align='center', fig.cap = "The marketing research process"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/mr_process_marketing.JPG")
```

* Descriptive, predictive, prescriptive

* Primary vs. secondary data
Primary: 
Data originated by the researcher for the specific purpose of addressing the research problem
This data is analyzed and may be published by the researcher

Secondary data:
Data collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand
Published in the form of books, articles, and databases by governments, business sources, or market research firms


* Qualitative vs. quantitative data
--> Exploratory vs. conclusive research (include in quant vs. qual)
-->  Focus on quantitative conclusive studies

* Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional data

```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '60%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal design"}

```

             ),
    Description = c("How can the customers of our online store be partitioned in classes defined by their characteristics?", 
             "<b>Features</b>: user characteristics (age, gender, location, ...), product characteristics of visited pages, ...; ",
             "Cluster Anaylsis <br> ..."
             ),
    Prediction = c(
      "What is the probability that users who visited our online store last year will purchase from our store within the next month?", 
             "<b>Output</b>: making a purchases within the next month<br>
              <b>Inputs</b>: age, gender, frequency of past purchases, recency of last purchases, monetary value of past purchases, past ad exposures, ...",
             "Regression<br>Decision trees<br>Random forests<br>Support vector machines<br>Neural networks<br> ..."
    ),
    "Causal Inference" = c(
      "Will behavioral targeting in online advertising increase, on average, the probability of purchasing from our store within the next month?", 
             "<b>Outcome</b>: making a purchases within the next month<br>
              <b>Treatment</b>: initiation of re-targeting campaign<br>
              <b>Confounders</b>: for non-experimental settings (interest in product category, eligibility criteria used for targeting ...)",
             "Experiments with random assignment<br>
              Regression<br>
              Instrumental variables<br>
              Regression discontinuity<br>
              Difference-in-differences<br>
              ...
              "
             )
    )

#pander::pander(mytable_sub, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style = 'grid', justify = 'left')
mytable_sub_1 %>% kable(escape = F,col.names = c("","Description","Prediction","Causal Inference")) %>% 
  column_spec(1,width =  "100",extra_css = 'vertical-align: top !important;') %>% 
  column_spec(2,width =  "100",extra_css = "vertical-align: top !important;") %>% 
  column_spec(3,width =  "100",extra_css = "vertical-align: top !important;") %>% 
  column_spec(4,width =  "100",extra_css = "vertical-align: top !important;") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  footnote(general = "Based on the classification of data science tasks by HernÃ¡n et al. (2019)",
           general_title = "Note: ", 
           footnote_as_chunk = T, title_format = c("italic")
           ) %>% 
  #add_header_above(c("Data Science Tasks" = 4), font_size = 20) %>% 
  row_spec(2, background = "#E0E0E0") %>% row_spec(c(0,1,3), background = "white") %>%
  row_spec(0, align = "c",bold=T) 
```

--> the exposed and unexposed populations are different in outcomes for reasons having nothing to do with the advertising

* Determine the research objective
* Descriptive, predictive, prescriptive

#### Descriptive research

* Capture the data structure

Although not the focus of this course, a third type of modeling, which is the most commonly used and developed by statisticians, is descriptive modeling. This type of modeling is aimed at summarizing or representing the data structure in a compact manner. Unlike explanatory modeling, in descriptive modeling the reliance on an underlying causal theory is absent or incorporated in a less formal way. Also, the focus is at the measurable level rather than at the construct level. Unlike predictive modeling, descriptive modeling is not aimed at prediction. Fitting a regression model can be descriptive if it is used for capturing the association between the dependent and independent variables rather than for causal inference or for prediction.We mention this type of modeling to avoid confusion with causal explanatory and predictive modeling, and also to highlight the different approaches of statisticians and nonstatisticians.

--> shifting paradime where you have access to large data sets and descriptive research becomes more important (Ailawadi)

#### Predictive research

* Interest in predictions of future observations (e.g., R2, hold-out prediction)
* No concern about causality
* E.g., concerns about overfitting

#### Causal inference

In social sciences, most research questions are causal.

* Theory: interest in regression coefficient
* Testing and comparing existing causal theories
* Concerns about e.g., 
    * unobserved confounders
    * selection bias (e.g., panel attrition)
    * measurement error

##### Observational research

However, in many situations, experiments are not feasible, not appropriate, or too costly. In general, if we think of the `four Ps' taxonomy, while experimentation is increasingly used to inform advertising decisions, practitioners and researchers rarely run field experiments to inform channels and product development because they are too time-consuming or often require a level of measurement of long-term implications that precludes feasible experimentation. In addition, field experiments with pricing are often problematic in that customers can find them unfair. More generally, as Andrew Gelman writes, Given the manifest virtues of experiments, why do I almost always analyze observational data? The short answer is ...

Angrist and Pischke (8) describe what they call the âFurious Five methods of causal inferenceâ: random assignment, regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and differences in differences.

Quasi-experimental tools mimic the random assignment that is inherent in lab experi-
ments and that is often referred to as the `gold standard' for identifying causal relationships.

## Measurement and scaling

### Scale characteristics

### Levels of measurement

#### Categorical (non-metric) variables

##### Nominal scales

* Numbers only serve as labels for identification and categorization
* Numbers do not reflect the amount of the characteristic possessed by the objects  
* Called âbinaryâ for two categories
* Only permissible operation is counting

<br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '50%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Example: nominal scale"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/scaletype_1.JPG")
```

##### Ordinal scales

* Numbers indicate the relative position of objects
* But not the magnitude of difference between them
* Besides counting, less than/greater than relations are possible
* Also statistics based on centiles, e.g., quartile, median

<br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '50%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Example: ordinal scale"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/scaletype_2.JPG")
```

#### Continuous (metric) variables

##### Interval scales

* Differences between objects can be compared (equal intervals)
* But zero point is arbitrary
* Not meaningful to take ratios of scale values
* In addition, statistics such as range, mean, and standard deviation can be computed

<br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '50%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Example: interval scale"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/scaletype_3.JPG")
```

##### Ratio scales

* Possesses all properties of nominal, ordinal and interval scales
* Has an absolute zero point
* Meaningful to compute ratios of scale values  
* All statistical techniques can be applied to ratio data

<br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '50%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Example: ratio scale"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/scaletype_4.JPG")
```

### Measurement accuracy

<br>
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = '60%',fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Example: nominal scale"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/validity_reliability.JPG")
```

### Scaling techniques

#### Single vs. multi-item scales

#### Formative vs. reflective scales
