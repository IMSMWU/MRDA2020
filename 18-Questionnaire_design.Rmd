# Questionnaire design

Welcome to the survey design guide!

An aim of this course is to develop your the ability to translate business problems into actionable research questions and to design an adequate research plan to answer these questions. In order to do so, you need become familiar with conducting a survey and follow certain steps.

Generally, what you can expect from the survey design is similar to what one experiences in a relationship. If you try to take more than you commit, it doesnâ€™t work out. Now on a serious note, if you follow guidelines mentioned here, you will certainly avoid usual traps your fellow collegues were caught in.

In a research process, conducting a survey is a part of (primary) data collection. Before we collect data we have to make sure that preceding steps such as problem definition are correctly done. However, in the following sections we will focus on the process of designing a questionnaire, so that you could be able to collect relevant data and apply appropriate statistical tests.

## Questionnaire design process

A structured questionnaire is a research instrument designed to elicit specific information from a sample of a target population. Usually it is used in a standardized way using fixed-alternative questions (same questions and response options for all respondents).

An objective of a questionnaire is threefold:
** to translate the information need into a set of specific questions that the respondent can and will answer,
** to motivate, and encourage respondents to become involved, to cooperate, and to complete the questionnaire,
** to minimize response error.
