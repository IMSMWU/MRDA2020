# Exercises

## Exercise in Machine learning (IN PROGRESS)

```{r,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
escooter.may <- read.csv("bikesJuly.csv")
escooter.aug <- read.csv("bikesAugust.csv")
```

In this exercise you will fit a gradient boosting model using xgboost package to predict the number of e-scooters rented in an hour. Features in the data set are related to weather conditions and other important information. Your task will be to train the model on data from one month (i.e. May) and do prediction on data for another month (i.e. June).

### Exercise to download (IN PROGRESS)

In this exercise you will fit a gradient boosting model using xgboost package to predict the number of e-scooters rented in an hour. Features in the data set are related to weather conditions and other important information. Your task will be to train the model on data from one month (i.e. May) and do prediction on data for another month (i.e. June).

```{r,eval=F,echo=F}
# The number of trees to use, as determined by xgb.cv
ntrees

# Run xgboost
bike_model_xgb <- xgboost(data = as.matrix(bikesJuly.treat), # training data as matrix
                          label = bikesJuly$cnt,  # column of outcomes
                          nrounds = ntrees,       # number of trees to build
                          objective = "reg:linear", # objective
                          eta = 0.3,
                          depth = 6,
                          verbose = 0  # silent
)

# Make predictions
bikesAugust$pred <- predict(bike_model_xgb, as.matrix(bikesAugust.treat))

# Plot predictions vs actual bike rental count
ggplot(bikesAugust, aes(x = pred, y = cnt)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline()


```
