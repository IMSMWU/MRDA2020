# (PART) Course outline {-}

# Welcome! {-}

This is an introduction to statistics using the statistical software R presented at WU Vienna. TEST. change something.<br>

The tutorial is intended to facilitate the learning process by summarizing the content that was covered in class. It includes the code files that we used during each session, along with the commented outputs and explanations in text and video format. You can use it as a reference for this course but also for other courses that you will take throughout your studies.  
<br>
None of the material on the following pages is new, nor is it invented by us. We intend to provide a summary of existing material interesting to the marketing researcher. We have cited the sources used for all the tutorials. However, if we have not given you appropriate credit for your work or failed to cite something correctly please [contact us through the github page of this course](https://github.com/IMSMWU/MRDA_issues) so we can resolve the issue amicably.

In addition to these lecture notes, there are many excellent books available (many of them for free) that focus on different aspects of R. In case you would like to learn more about the capabilities of R, I can recommend the following books:

* __"[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)"__ An excellent book by Hadley Wickham, which introduces you to R as a tool for doing data science, focussing on a consistent set of packages known as the tidyverse. [FREE online version]

* __"[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)"__ This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods and covers basic methods (e.g., linear regression) as well as more advanced methods (e.g., Support Vector Machines). [FREE online version]

* __"[R for Marketing Research and Analytics](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/)"__ A great book that is designed to teach R to marketing practitioners and data scientists.

* __"[Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/)"__ XXX. [FREE online version]

* __"[Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/)"__ This book explains how you can analyze unstructured data (texts) using R. [FREE online version]

* __"[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)"__ another great book written by Hadley Wickham. Explains more advanced R concepts. [FREE online version]

* __"[Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)"__ to learn about the approach and to gain intuition about methods accepted in the machine learning in R. The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of machine learning through concrete examples and just a little bit of theory.[FREE online version]

* __"[Hands-On Data Science for Marketing](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Data-Science-for-Marketing)"__ XXX. [FREE Code exercises]

* __"[R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)"__ XXX. [FREE Code exercises]
