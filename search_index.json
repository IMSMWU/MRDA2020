Please see the newest version of the course here: wu-rds.github.io/MRDA2021/              Welcome to the course Marketing Research Design &amp; Analysis! Due to the limited activity on campus this semester, this course will be delivered using distance learning. This means that students are required to familiarize themselves with the contents by means of self-study. This website is intended to aid the self-study process by providing you with explanations regarding the relevant concepts and methods in text and video format along with code files and commented outputs that will show you how to implement these methods using the statistical software R. The self-learning process will be complemented with weekly interactive Q&amp;A sessions via live video streaming (Zoom), which provide ample opportunities to ask questions and clarify points that require further discussion. The following pages outline the course schedule and explain how to use this tutorial in detail. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a short email. Nils Wlömert (nils.wloemert@wu.ac.at) Acknowledgements This tutorial is supported through Digital Learning Project Funding by WU Vienna. None of the materials covered in this tutorial are new. We intend to provide a summary of existing methods from a marketing research perspective and cite the corresponding sources. If you should have any comments or suggestions, please contact us through the github page of this course.
